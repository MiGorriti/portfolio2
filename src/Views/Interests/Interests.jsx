        <p>
          Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
          outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier. During the warmer months
          here in Buenos Aires, I enjoy going to the beach, relaxing, driving
          long distances, and traveling.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-0">
          When I'm indoors, I enjoy watching sci-fi and detective movies,
          playing video games, and indulging in my passion for cooking. A
          significant portion of my free time is dedicated to exploring the
          latest technological advancements in the world of front-end web
          development. Additionally, I have a strong enthusiasm for learning
          foreign languages and am currently studying both German and Italian.
